Congratulations! Rooshaw

You have made it such a long way from where you started, creating an alias for running python code quickly and 
making a number of files along the way. I can't speak for where you are now but Past You is proud of all you
have achieved and i hope you continue on this journey of discovery.

I can't wait to see where we've ended up!

All my love and hope,
Past Self
