Most of the scripts here are dirty and untidy but functional all the same. They're mostly for my own purpose and development but if you're here then i will have shared access for something at some point or by the power of the internet, here you are. 

## Kube Repo
Most of this is for Confluent Cloud tasks and Kafka tasks. 

## Terraform
This is empty for now

## Codedex
This is a playground repo for learning python
